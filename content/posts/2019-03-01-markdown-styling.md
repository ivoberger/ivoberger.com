**Blog posts in Bleda are written using Markdown. However, you are free to use HTML inside Markdown, for any elements not covered by the spec.** 

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

Heading 1 is the title of this page. You should only use it once in a document.

## Links

When you paste in a URL like so: https://gridsome.org, it will be automatically converted to a link. Otherwise, you can use the standard `[link text](https://...)` markdown to create a link.

## Ordered list

1. python 
2. root 
3. public 
4. bypass

## Unordered list

- boolean 
- stack 
- foad 
- tarball 

## A definition list

This list is created using `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` HTML tags.

<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>

## Blockquotes

## Code

### Fenced codeblocks

Bleda uses [gridsome-plugin-remark-shiki](https://github.com/EldoranDev/gridsome-plugin-remark-shiki) to add syntax highlighting to code blocks. Roll with the default light one, or choose one of the other [themes available](https://github.com/octref/shiki/tree/master/packages/themes).

```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>My Todo App!</h1>
    <TodoList/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import TodoList from './components/TodoList.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    TodoList
  }
}
</script>

<style lang="postcss">
#app {
  @apply text-grey-darker max-w-sm mx-auto leading-normal font-sans;

  h1 {
    @apply text-black text-4xl;
  }
}
</style>
```

Of course, it also styles `inline code blocks`.

## Images

Here's a local image:

As you just saw, Gridsome loads it only when it enters your viewport.

Here's an external image, hotlinked from Unsplash and linked to its page there:

As you can see, the lightbox is not used for linked images. Also, if the URL they link to is external, it will open in a new tab - just like the one above.
