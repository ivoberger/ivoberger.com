Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

Yes, Yes, without the oops! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. What do they got in there? King Kong? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Life finds a way. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

I was part of something special. Life finds a way. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

What do they got in there? King Kong? You really think you can fly that thing? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!

Checkmate... Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? What do they got in there? King Kong?
