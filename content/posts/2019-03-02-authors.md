Just like with tags, you can also organise your posts by author.

Simply add an `author: some-name` to your posts' Front Matter, and the author collection and URLs will be automatically generated.

## Multi-author blogs

You can use unique author names to create a 'multi-author' blog. Checkout the [getting started post](/getting-started-with-gridsome-and-bleda/), it's written by a different author.

Note: a post can only have one author.

## Author avatars

Add author avatars in the `/static/images/authors` directory. The name of the file must match the author name in your Front Matter, and it must be a PNG.

For example, `author: john-doe` will use `/static/images/authors/john-doe.png`

If a matching avatar image is not found, or it failed to load, Bleda will try to use `default.png` from the same directory.

## No authors? That's OK.

You don't _have_ to add an author to a post. Posts with no author will simply not show the author name anywhere, and will not be included in the author archive pages.
