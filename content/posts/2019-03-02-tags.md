Tags in Bleda are defined in your posts's Front matter.

You can specify them in either YAML format:

```yaml
---
# ... other fields
tags:
    - getting-started
    - content
---
```

Or in array format:

```yaml
---
# ... other fields
tags: ['getting-started', 'content']
---
```

On archive pages (homepage, tags page, author page), only the first tag will be shown. The single post view will show all tags at the bottom.

## Slug format

Each tag must be written in 'slug' format: `lowercase-words-separated-by-a-dash`

## Case-sensitive

Tag names are case-sensitive. Because of this, you can't have a post tagged `design` and and another one tagged `Design`.

## No tags? No problem!

You don't _have_ to add tags to your posts: if you don't, the archives and single post views will simply not show them.
